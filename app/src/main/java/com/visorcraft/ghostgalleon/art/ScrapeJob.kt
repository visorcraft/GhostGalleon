/**
 * Application-scoped owner of the SteamGridDB batch scrape. The job used to
 * be owned by SettingsActivity, so leaving the settings screen mid-run
 * cancelled a multi-thousand-ROM job. The lifecycle now lives in
 * GhostGalleonApp: the settings row only binds a listener while resumed.
 * If the process dies the job dies with it — acceptable, a re-run resumes
 * where cached art left off.
 *
 * The runner seam ([ScrapeRunner]) keeps this class host-testable; the real
 * runner is an [SgdbScraper] over [HttpSgdbTransport]. Runner callbacks
 * already arrive on the main thread, so listener callbacks do too.
